The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.<br /><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">In short:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about the data that we process about you.</p><p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. Where it is conducive to transparency, technical <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">terms are explained in a reader-friendly way</strong>, links to further information are provided and <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">graphics</strong> are used. We thus inform you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data as part of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if we provide the most concise, unclear and legal-technical explanations possible, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is one or two pieces of information that you did not yet know.<br />If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the legal notice, follow the links provided and look at further information on third-party sites. Our contact details can of course also be found in the legal notice.</p><h2 id=\"scope of application\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Scope of application</h2><p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, email address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes</p><ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">all online presences (websites, online stores) that we operate</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Social media presences and email communication</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li></ul><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">In short:</strong> The privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner within the company via the aforementioned channels. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p><h2 id=\"rechtsgrundlagen\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Legal bases</h2><p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br />As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016. You can of course access this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p><p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p><ol><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of the data you entered in a contact form.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Contract</strong> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): In order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"> Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website securely and efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.</li></ol><p>Further conditions such as the performance of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not generally arise for us. If such a legal basis is relevant, it will be indicated at the appropriate point.</p><p>In addition to the EU Regulation, national laws also apply:</p><ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">In <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Österreich</strong> this is the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (<strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Data Protection Act</strong>), or <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">DSG</strong> for short.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">In <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Germany</strong>, the <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Federal Data Protection Act</strong>, in short<strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"> BDSG</strong>, applies.</li></ul><p>If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p><h2 id=\"contact-data-controller\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Contact details of the controller</h2><p>If you have any questions about data protection or the processing of personal data, you will find below the contact details of the controller in accordance with Article 4(7) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):<br /><span class=\"adsimple-112966637\" style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gabsii Digital System GmbH<br />Lukas Samir Gabsi<br />Herrengutgasse 18<br />6923 Lauterach<br />Austria</span></p><p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:hello@gabsii.com\">hello@gabsii.com</a><br />Phone: <a href=\"tel:+43 680 5039884\">+43 680 5039884</a><br />Imprint: <a href=\"https://www.gabsii.com/impressum/\">https://www.gabsii.com/impressum/</a></p><h2 id=\"storage duration\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Storage duration</h2><p>We generally only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes.</p><p>If you request the deletion of your data or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible and insofar as there is no obligation to store it.</p><p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing if we have further information on this.</p><h2 id=\"rights-dsgvo\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h2><p>In accordance with Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, we inform you of the following rights to which you are entitled in order to ensure fair and transparent data processing:</p><ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">According to Article 15 GDPR, you have a right of access as to whether we process data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and the following information:<ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">what purpose we are processing it for;</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">the categories, i.e. the types of data being processed;</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">who receives this data and, if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">how long the data is stored;</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">the existence of the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing;</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">the origin of the data if we have not collected it from you;</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to create a personal profile of you.</li></ul></li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">According to Article 16 GDPR, you have the right to rectification of data, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to erasure (\"right to be forgotten\"), which specifically means that you may request the erasure of your data.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we may only store the data but not use it any further.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">According to Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a commonly used format upon request.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">According to Article 21 GDPR, you have the right to object, which entails a change in processing after enforcement.<ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">If data is used for direct marketing purposes, you can object to this type of data processing at any time.

We may then no longer use your data for profiling.</li></ul></li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Under Article 22 GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (e.g. profiling).</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Under Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the data processing of personal data violates the GDPR.</li></ul><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">In short:</strong> You have rights &#8211; do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed above!</p><p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website you can find at <a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://www.dsb.gv.at/?tid=112966637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more information, you can contact the <a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)</a>. The following local data protection authority is responsible for our company:</p><h2 id=\"oesterreich-datenschutzbehoerde\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Austrian Data Protection Authority</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Head: </strong>Dr. Matthias Schmidl<strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><br />Address: </strong>Barichgasse 40-42, 1030 Vienna<strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><br />Telephone: </strong>+43 1 52 152-0<strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><br />E-mail address: </strong><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"mailto:dsb@dsb.gv.at\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dsb@dsb.gv.at</a><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><br />Website: </strong><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://www.dsb.gv.at/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a></p><h2 id=\"datenuebertragung-drittlaender\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Data transfer to third countries</h2><p>We only transfer or process data to countries outside the scope of the GDPR (third countries) if you consent to this processing or if other legal permission exists. This applies in particular if the processing is required by law or necessary to fulfill a contractual relationship and in any case only to the extent that this is generally permitted. In most cases, your consent is the most important reason why we process data in third countries. The processing of personal data in third countries such as the USA, where many software manufacturers offer services and have their server locations, may mean that personal data is processed and stored in unexpected ways.</p><p>We expressly point out that, in the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently only an adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA if a US company that processes personal data of EU citizens in the USA is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. You can find more information on this at <a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en</a></p><p>Data processing by US services that are not active participants in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework may result in data not being processed and stored anonymously. Furthermore, US government authorities may be able to access individual data. In addition, data collected may be linked to data from other services of the same provider if you have a corresponding user account. Where possible, we try to use server locations within the EU, if this is offered.<br />We will inform you in more detail about data transfer to third countries, if applicable, in the appropriate sections of this privacy policy.</p><h2 id=\"security-data-processing\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Security of data processing</h2><p>We have implemented both technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. Where possible, we encrypt or pseudonymize personal data. In this way, we make it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer personal information from our data.</p><p>Art. 25 GDPR refers to &#8220;data protection by design and by default&#8221; and means that we always think about security and take appropriate measures for both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to the server room). If necessary, we will go into specific measures below.</p><h2 id=\"tls-verschluesselung-https\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">TLS encryption with https</h2><p>TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, and they are. We use HTTPS (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure stands for \"secure hypertext transfer protocol\") to transmit data tap-proof on the Internet.<br />This means that the complete transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured &#8211; nobody can &#8220;eavesdrop&#8221;.</p><p>This means that we have introduced an additional layer of security and comply with data protection by design (<a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=112966637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Article 25(1) GDPR</a>). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data.<br />You can recognize the use of this data transmission security by the small lock symbol <img role=\"img\" src=\"https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/schlosssymbol-https.svg\" width=\"17\" height=\"18\" /> at the top left of the browser, to the left of the Internet address (e.g. examplepage.com) and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our Internet address.<br />If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend a Google search for &#8220;Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki&#8221; to get good links to further information.</p><h2 id=\"kommunikation\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Kommunikation</h2><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"15\"><tbody><tr><td><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Communication summary</strong><br />&#x1f465; Affected parties: Anyone who communicates with us by telephone, email or online form<br />&#x1f4d3; Processed data: e.g. telephone number, name, email address, email address, telephone number&#x1f4d3; Data subject. e.g. telephone number, name, e-mail address, form data entered.

Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p><p>For example, cookie data may look like this:</p><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Name:</strong> _ga<br /><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152112966637-9<br /><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Purpose:</strong> Differentiation of website visitors<br /><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p><p>A browser should be able to support these minimum sizes:</p><ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">At least 50 cookies per domain</p><p/li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">At least 3000 cookies in total</li></ul><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">What types of cookies are there?</h3><p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the following sections of the privacy policy. At this point, we would like to briefly explain the different types of HTTP cookies.</p><p>We can distinguish between 4 types of cookies:</p><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Necessary cookies<br /></strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic website functions. For example, these cookies are needed when a user places a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other pages and only goes to the checkout later. These cookies ensure that the shopping cart is not deleted even if the user closes their browser window.</p><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Purposeful cookies<br /></strong>These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages. In addition, these cookies are also used to measure the loading time and the behavior of the website with different browsers.</p><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Target-oriented cookies<br /></strong>These cookies ensure better user-friendliness. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form data are saved.</p><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Advertising cookies<br /></strong>These cookies are also known as targeting cookies. They are used to deliver customized advertising to the user. This can be very practical, but also very annoying.</p><p>When you visit a website for the first time, you are usually asked which of these types of cookie you would like to allow. And of course, this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p><p>If you want to know more about cookies and don't shy away from technical documentation, we recommend <a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265\">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called &#8220;HTTP State Management Mechanism&#8221;.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Purpose of processing via cookies</h3><p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find more details on this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">What data is processed?</h3><p>Cookies are little helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalize which data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the processed or stored data in the following data protection declaration.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Storage duration of cookies</h3><p>The storage duration depends on the respective cookie and is specified below. Some cookies are deleted after less than an hour, others can remain stored on a computer for several years.</p><p>You can also influence the storage period yourself. You can delete all cookies manually at any time via your browser (see also &#8220;Right to object&#8221; below). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent are deleted at the latest after you withdraw your consent, whereby the legality of the storage remains unaffected until then.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Right to object &#8211; how can I delete cookies?</h3><p>You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies originate from, you always have the option of deleting, deactivating or only partially allowing cookies. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p><p>If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p><p><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=112966637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chrome: Delete, activate and manage cookies in Chrome</a></p><p><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-at/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=112966637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Safari: Manage cookies and website data with Safari</a></p><p><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en/kb/cookies-and-website-data-in-firefox-delete?tid=112966637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firefox: Delete cookies to remove data that websites have stored on your computer</a></p><p><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/l%C3%B6schen-und-verwalten-von-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d?tid=112966637\">Internet Explorer: Löschen und Verwalten von Cookies</a></p><p><a class=\"adsimple-112966637\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-edge/cookies-in-microsoft-edge-l%C3%B6schen-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09?tid=112966637\">Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies</a></p><p>If you do not want any cookies at all, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can then decide for each individual cookie whether or not to allow it. The procedure differs depending on the browser. It is best to search for the instructions in Google using the search term \"delete cookies Chrome\" or &#8220;deactivate cookies Chrome&#8221; in the case of a Chrome browser.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Legal basis</h3><p>The so-called \"cookie guidelines\" have been in place since 2009. This states that the storage of cookies requires your <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). However, there are still very different reactions to these directives within the EU countries. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 165 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (2021). In Germany, the cookie directives have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this directive was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG), which has been replaced by the Digital Services Act (DDG) since May 2024.</p><p>For strictly necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to provide visitors to the website with a pleasant user experience and certain cookies are often absolutely necessary for this.</p><p>If cookies that are not absolutely necessary are used, this will only be done with your consent. The legal basis in this respect is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p><p>In the following sections, you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies if the software used uses cookies.</p><h2 id=\"web-analytics-introduction\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Web Analytics introduction</h2><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"15\"><tbody><tr><td><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Web Analytics Privacy Policy Summary</strong><br />&#x1f465; Data subject: Visitors to the website<br />&#x1f91d; Purpose: Evaluation of visitor information to optimize the website.<br />&#x1f4d3; Processed data: Access statistics that contain data such as access locations, device data, access duration and time, navigation behavior, click behavior and IP addresses. You can find more details on this in the respective web analytics tool used.<br />&#x1f4c5; Storage period: depending on the web analytics tool used<br />&#x2696;&#xfe0f; Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">What is web analytics?</h3><p>We use software on our website to evaluate the behavior of website visitors, known as web analytics or web analysis for short. This involves collecting data that is stored, managed and processed by the respective analytics tool provider (also known as a tracking tool). The data is used to create analyses of user behavior on our website and made available to us as the website operator. In addition, most tools offer various test options. For example, we can test which offers or content are best received by our visitors. To do this, we show you two different offers for a limited period of time. After the test (known as an A/B test), we know which product or content our website visitors find more interesting. For such test procedures, as well as for other analytics procedures, user profiles can also be created and the data stored in cookies.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Why do we use web analytics?</h3><p>We have a clear goal for our website: we want to deliver the best web offering on the market for our industry. In order to achieve this goal, we want to offer the best and most interesting range of services on the one hand and make sure that you feel completely at ease on our website on the other. With the help of web analysis tools, we can take a closer look at the behavior of our website visitors and then improve our website accordingly for you and for us. For example, we can see how old our visitors are on average, where they come from, when our website is visited the most or which content or products are particularly popular. All this information helps us to optimize the website and thus adapt it to your needs, interests and wishes.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">What data is processed?</h3><p>Which data is stored exactly depends on the analysis tools used, of course. However, as a rule, for example, the content you view on our website, which buttons or links you click on, when you access a page, which browser you use, which device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you use to visit the website or which computer system you use is stored. If you have agreed that location data may also be collected, this may also be processed by the web analysis tool provider.</p><p>In addition, your IP address is also stored. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), IP addresses are personal data. However, your IP address is usually stored pseudonymized (i.e. in an unrecognizable and shortened form). For the purpose of testing, web analysis and web optimization, no direct data such as your name, age, address or e-mail address is stored. All this data, if collected, is stored in pseudonymized form. This means that you cannot be identified as a person.</p><p>The following example shows schematically how Google Analytics works as an example of client-based web tracking with Java Script code.</p><p><img role=\"img\" src=\"https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/google-analytics-dataflow.svg\" alt=\"Schematic data flow with Google Analytics\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p>How long the respective data is stored always depends on the provider. Some cookies only store data for a few minutes or until you leave the website, while other cookies can store data for several years.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><span class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Duration of data processing</span></h3><p>We will inform you below about the duration of data processing if we have further information on this. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. If required by law, for example in the case of accounting, this storage period may also be exceeded.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Right to object</h3><p>You also have the right and opportunity to withdraw your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection by cookies by managing, deactivating or deleting cookies in your browser.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Legal basis</h3><p>The use of web analytics requires your consent, which we have obtained with our cookie pop-up. According to<strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"> Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent)</strong>, this consent constitutes the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as may occur when it is collected by web analytics tools.</p><p>In addition to consent, we have a legitimate interest in analyzing the behavior of website visitors and thus improving our offer technically and economically. With the help of web analytics, we can detect errors on the website, identify attacks and improve efficiency. The legal basis for this is <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. Nevertheless, we only use the tools if you have given your consent.</p><p>Since web analytics tools use cookies, we also recommend that you read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly what data of yours is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><p>Information on specific web analytics tools, you will find &#8211; if available &#8211; in the following sections.</p><h2 id=\"security-anti-spam\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Security &amp; Anti-Spam</h2><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"15\"><tbody><tr><td><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Security &amp; Anti-Spam Privacy Policy Summary</strong><br />&#x1f465; Data subjects: Visitors to the website<br />&#x1f91d; Purpose: Cyber security<br />&#x1f4d3; Processed data: Data such as your IP address, name or technical data such as browser version<br />More details can be found below and in the individual data protection texts.<br />&#x1f4c5; Storage period: Most of the data is stored until it is no longer required for the performance of the service<br />&#x2696;&#xfe0f; Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">What is security &amp; anti-spam software?</h3><p>So-called security &amp; anti-spam software can protect you and us from various spam or phishing emails and possible other cyberattacks. Spam refers to advertising emails from a mass mailing that you did not request yourself. Such emails are also known as data junk and can also cause costs. Phishing emails, on the other hand, are messages that aim to build trust via fake messages or websites in order to obtain personal data. Anti-spam software generally protects against unwanted spam messages or malicious emails that could introduce viruses into our system. We also use general firewall and security systems to protect our computers from unwanted network attacks.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Why do we use security &amp; anti-spam software?</h3><p>We attach great importance to security on our website. After all, it's not just about our security, but above all about yours. Unfortunately, cyber threats are now part of everyday life in the world of IT and the Internet. Hackers often try to steal personal data from an IT system with the help of a cyber attack. And that is why a good defense system is absolutely essential. A security system monitors all incoming and outgoing connections to our network or computer. To achieve even greater security against cyber attacks, we also use other external security services in addition to the standardized security systems on our computer. This prevents unauthorized data traffic and protects us from cybercrime.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">What data is processed by security &amp; anti-spam software?</h3><p>Which data is collected and stored depends on the respective service, of course. However, we always strive to use only programs that collect data very sparingly or only store data that is necessary to provide the service offered. In principle, the service may store data such as name, address, IP address, e-mail address and technical data such as browser type or browser version. Any performance and log data may also be collected in order to detect possible incoming threats in good time. This data is processed as part of the services and in compliance with the applicable laws. This also includes the GDPR for US providers (via the standard contractual clauses). In some cases, these security services also work with third-party providers who may store and/or process data under instructions and in accordance with the data protection guidelines and other security measures. Data is usually stored via cookies.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Duration of data processing</h3><p>We will inform you about the duration of data processing below if we have further information on this. For example, security programs store data until you or we revoke the data storage. In general, personal data is only stored for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of the services. In many cases, we unfortunately do not receive precise information from the providers about the length of storage.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Right to object</h3><p>You also have the right and opportunity to withdraw your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers of security software at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection by cookies by managing, deactivating or deleting cookies in your browser.</p><p>Since cookies may also be used by such security services, we recommend that you read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly what data of yours is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective tools.</p><h3 class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Legal basis</h3><p>We use the security services mainly on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in a good security system against various cyber attacks.</p><p>Certain processing operations, in particular the use of cookies and the use of security functions, require your consent. If you have consented to your data being processed and stored by integrated security services, this consent is the legal basis for data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Most of the services we use set cookies in your browser to store data. We therefore recommend that you read our data protection text on cookies carefully and view the privacy policy or cookie policy of the respective service provider.</p><p>You can find information on special tools &#8211; if available &#8211; in the following sections.</p><h2 id=\"explanation-of-terms-used\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Explanation of terms used</h2><p>We always endeavor to write our privacy policy as clearly and comprehensibly as possible. However, this is not always easy, especially when it comes to technical and legal topics. It often makes sense to use legal terms (such as personal data) or certain technical terms (such as cookies, IP address). However, we do not want to use these without explanation. Below you will find an alphabetical list of important terms used, which we may not have sufficiently addressed in the previous privacy policy. If these terms have been taken from the GDPR and are definitions, we will also quote the GDPR texts here and add our own explanations if necessary.</p><h2 id=\"processor\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Processor</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">\"processor\"</strong> a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;</em></p></blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Explanation:</strong> As a company and website owner, we are responsible for all data that we process from you. In addition to controllers, there may also be so-called processors. This includes any company or person that processes personal data on our behalf. In addition to service providers such as tax consultants, processors can therefore also be hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.</p><h2 id=\"consent\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Consent</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this regulation, the term:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">\"consent\"</strong> any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;</em></p></blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">explanation: </strong>In general, websites use a cookie consent tool to obtain such consent. You probably know this. Whenever you visit a website for the first time, you are usually asked via a banner whether you agree or consent to data processing. In most cases, you can also make individual settings and decide for yourself which data processing you allow and which you do not. If you do not give your consent, your personal data may not be processed. In principle, consent can of course also be given in writing, i.e. not via a tool.</p><h2 id=\"personal-data\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Personal data</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term:</p><blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><em>\"personal data\"</em></strong><em> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as \"data subject\"); An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</em></p></blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Explanation:</strong> Personal data is therefore all data that can identify you as a person. This is usually data such as:</p><ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Name</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Adresse</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">E-Mail-Adresse</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Post-Anschrift</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Telefonnummer</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Date of birth</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Identification numbers such as social security number, tax identification number, ID card number or matriculation number</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Bank details such as account number, credit information, account balances and much more.</li></ul><p>According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), your <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">IP address is also considered personal data</strong>. IT experts can use your IP address to determine at least the approximate location of your device and, subsequently, you as the owner of the connection. Therefore, the storage of an IP address also requires a legal basis within the meaning of the GDPR. There are also so-called <strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">\"special categories\"</strong> of personal data that are also particularly worthy of protection. These include:</p><ul class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">racial and ethnic origin</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">political opinions</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">religious or philosophical beliefs</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">ideological convictions</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">trade union membership</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">genetic data such as data taken from blood or saliva samples</li/li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">biometric data (i.e. information on mental, physical or behavioral characteristics that can identify a person)<br />Health data</li><li class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Data on sexual orientation or sex life</li></ul><h2 id=\"profiling\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Profiling</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">\"profiling\"</strong> any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements;</em></p></blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">explanation:</strong> Profiling involves collecting various pieces of information about a person in order to learn more about that person. In the web sector, profiling is often used for advertising purposes or for credit checks. For example, web and advertising analysis programs collect data about your behavior and interests on a website. This results in a specific user profile that can be used to target advertising to a specific target group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"responsible\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Responsible</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">\"controller\"</strong> means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</em></p></blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Explanation:</strong> In our case, we are responsible for the processing of your personal data and consequently the &#8220;controller&#8221;. If we pass on collected data to other service providers for processing, they are &#8220;processors&#8221;. An &#8220;order processing contract (AVV)&#8221; must be signed for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"processing\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Processing</h2><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p><blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\"><em>\"processing\"</em></strong><em> means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;</em></p></blockquote><p><strong class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Note: </strong>When we talk about processing in our privacy policy, we mean any kind of data processing. As mentioned above in the original GDPR statement, this includes not only the collection but also the storage and processing of data.</p><h2 id=\"keyword\" class=\"adsimple-112966637\">Closing words</h2><p>Congratulations! If you are reading this, you have really \"fought\" your way through our entire privacy policy, or at least scrolled this far. As you can see from the scope of our privacy policy, we take the protection of your personal data anything but lightly.<br />It is important to us to inform you about the processing of personal data to the best of our knowledge and belief. However, we don't just want to tell you what data is processed, but also explain the reasons for using various software programs. As a rule, privacy policies sound very technical and legal. However, as most of you are not web developers or lawyers, we wanted to take a different approach and explain the facts in simple and clear language. Of course, this is not always possible due to the subject matter. Therefore, the most important terms are explained in more detail at the end of the privacy policy.<br />If you have any questions about data protection on our website, please do not hesitate to contact us or the responsible office. We wish you a pleasant time and hope to welcome you back to our website soon.</p><p>All texts are protected by copyright.</p><p style=\"margin-top:15px\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.adsimple.at/datenschutz-generator/\" title=\"Privacy Policy Generator Austria\">Privacy Policy</a> created with the Privacy Policy Generator for Austria by AdSimple</p>"
